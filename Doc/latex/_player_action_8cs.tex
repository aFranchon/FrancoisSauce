\item 
class \mbox{\hyperlink{class_in_control_1_1_player_action}{In\+Control.\+Player\+Action}}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em This class represents a single action that may have multiple controls bound to it. A bound control is represented by a subclass of \mbox{\hyperlink{class_in_control_1_1_binding_source}{Binding\+Source}}. For example, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_in_control_1_1_device_binding_source}{Device\+Binding\+Source}} provides input from a control on any supported \mbox{\hyperlink{class_in_control_1_1_input_device}{Input\+Device}}. Similarly, \mbox{\hyperlink{class_in_control_1_1_key_binding_source}{Key\+Binding\+Source}} provides input from one or more keypresses. An action may have any number of bindings. Actions have two groups of bindings defined\+: default bindings and regular bindings. Default bindings are the predefined default bindings, and the current bindings for the action can be reset to this group in a single operation. Regular bindings are those added by users, most likely at runtime in a settings menu or the like. There are no other distinctions between these groupings; they are purely for organizational convenience. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
