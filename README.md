Unity lib to help building prototypes really fast

Will be updated often, my goal is to have everything needed to create a complete prototype of a game easily, and to give some tools to improve it when needed without much work

For now:
  - Global variables (Scriptable Objects to globaly keep values) witch can be changed and saved while in play mode
  - Events managing to easily and quickly create new events, also provides listeners to subscribe to them without writing any code.
  - Game Manager to handle additive scene loading with events all the way along the loading process of the scene
  - Scene/View logic to create and manage scenes with ease.
  - Complete documentation on all the code already in the project
  - Level manager to quickly add levels to the game
  - Complete documentation on all the code already in the project
  - Complete comments on all the code Already in the project
  - Complete game scene to finish the very basics of the project
  - Added comments on all new files 
  - Added tooltip on every public variable of the project
  - Added Auto add button on all the listeners

  
Coming soon:
  - Do know what but it'll be cool
  - Some Todo fixes
  
Last Updates:
  - Complete game scene to finish the very basics of the project
  - Added comments on all new files 
  - Added tooltip on every public variable of the project
  - Added Auto add button on all the listeners


NEEDED PAID ASSETS:
  - Odin: if you don't have odin you can still use the project. Just remove the ODIN_INSPECTOR Symbols in Edit->ProjectSettings->Player->OtherSettings->ScriptingDeviceSymbols (Erase the actual content and justpress enter, it will recompile your project without defining this symbol.
  - FantasyUI for some images, not mandatory to work, but looks nicer with it (I'll maybe do something about this one day)
  - InControl, for the basic movment exemple, will be remove shortly, project should not work without it. If you want to fast repair it just remove Player/.cs. The player won't be able to move but everything else will work.
